# VSCode User Settings

- Collection of my [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) user profile settings.

## Usage

The files can be individually edited in the editor by going to 'Preferences > Settings' and 'Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts'.

Alternatively, they can be cloned to the User folder of the VSCode installation on your platform:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`
- Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
